# Background in Computer Science

I am the current computer vision technical lead for Triton Robotics, one of the engineering organizations here on campus. We compete in the Robomaster Competition where we are tasked with designing robots armed with turrets to hunt down and destroy the robots on the other team in a first-person shooter-like comptetition. I lead the development of real time object tracking software that functions as an aimbot to provide coordinate data to our turrent to automatically aim and fire at any enemy robots it detects. 

I got into fullstack development this past summer, and really enjoy going to hackathons as well. You can find what I have developed for past hackathons at my [devpost](https://devpost.com/ethan-seiji-wads?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav).

### Teaching/Tutoring

---

I also really enjoy teaching and being involved with computer science education. I started tutoring for the computer science department here at UCSD last quarter for CSE 8A, and am tutoring for CSE 30 this quarter. I also teach basic image processing and computer vision to new Triton Robotics recruits, and wrote my own resources for this purpose that have step-by-step implementations of many of the algorithms in the opencv library. For anyone interested, these resources can be found [here](https://github.com/EthanWadsworth/TR_CV_Notes).
