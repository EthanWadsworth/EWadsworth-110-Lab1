# About Me

	title="my photo" width="50%" height="50%" />

`print(Hello World!)` My name is Ethan Wadsworth, and I am a current second-year computer sciecne major at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am from Downey, CA, but am actually currently living on campus here at UCSD in Warren. I also have a twin brother named Derek who also goes to UCSD.

I am more of a cat person (but I have nothing against dogs).

I mean, how can this not cheer you up?

# Background in Computer Science
I actually first started studying computer science while here at UCSD, but I spend a good amount of my free time learning about new concepts and technologies that interest me. My computer science interests include:
- Computer Vision
- Web programming (frontend and backend)
- Computer science education
  
The languages and technologies that I am familiar with include HTML/CSS, Node, Javascript, React, C, C++, Java, and Python. My favorite programming language has to be Python because it can be used for practically anything that suits your needs. From machine learning to data analysis to server programming, Python seems to have libraries for anything and everything (*even it is slow*). 

Basically any Python programmer when trying to write programs in other languages:
> "I can do that in 10 lines of Python code."

Just another reason why **_I like Python so much_**.
